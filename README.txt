LOGIN_MANAGER

The Project started @ 26/06/2021 & 19:00 
It took exactly 11hrs and 35min to been fully developed
It was builded for advertising purposes
(It helped me to show to a client what i can do in 12hrs straight coding)
(Also I was never realised that I can achive such progress in such limited time)
The Project that I was taking is much larger and harder to finish
(look to my HTML Projects)

It is a simple program that manages login inputs as a frontend to another program
So if anything when you need a login-signup-remeber_me frontend is ready on the fly
(for future purposes also <???>)

I Learned a lot of things about my self with this simple project
a) 24hr time is equal to 86.400 seconds
b) You can do anything you can imagine even in a limited amount of time
(12hrs was mine)
c) Everything is about your purpose
d) even simple programs can be impressive (with it I closed a client for bigger and better project)

This Project is very special to me because all the above and it stands out for the limited amount of time it took me to write it

cheers
